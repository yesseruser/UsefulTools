How to make a good and useful issue / PR:  
1. Use a shorter but meaningful descripton.
2. Choose a good name.
3. Pick tags that represent your issue/pull request.
4. I will try to review your contributions as soon as possible.

If you are making a pull request based on an issue, put "closes #<issue id>" in the description.

Do not put any bad language into your contributions.
